## I Used to Love Statistics—Then I Took a Statistics Class (in College)

As a high school student, I loved statistics. The joy of testing hypotheses, checking for significance, comparing groups—-I couldn’t believe we could use hard data to answer real-world questions.

As someone new to the U.S. and still in English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, math and statistics became safe harbors—-precise, logical, and in a language I understood better than English. Math, with its formulae and structure, gave me something I could solve and feel confident about.

That love of data, mixed with a lifelong fascination with how people think, behave, and make decisions, naturally led me to major in economics. And when you go to the University of Chicago, not so sure about what major to choose, it is natural to choose economics. (I was also drawn to psychology and physics, but my AP Psychology class was so difficult that even my friend, who got a D in the class, still managed a 5 on the AP exam, and I gave up on physics after my first semester in college.)

In college, my stats and math classes immediately turned into something unfamiliar. We weren’t analyzing data anymore—-we were proving whether sets were closed or bounded. We were proving and reconstructing addition and multiplication. We were diving into elegant derivations and proofs. 

Even econometrics—the field that was supposed to blend economic thinking with data—-felt like a mathematical performance: proving the same OLS results repeatedly, chasing asymptotic properties as if that were the goal.

I remember sitting in my college algebra class thinking: *I already know how to multiply two numbers. Why am I doing this?*

Even when mathematically minded friends described the beauty of certain proofs, I couldn’t shake the question: *What’s the point of all this if we’re not going to use it?*

## From Fear to Frameworks

Years later, I found myself on the other side of the classroom—teaching econometrics to undergraduates. And I finally understood why so many students fear econometrics.

It wasn’t just the math. It was the fact that the course had become something abstract, rather than a tool for understanding the world. We were teaching students how to rebuild addition and multiplication from scratch—just like in my algebra class—when we could’ve simply shown them how to use the tools and why they matter.

And I get it. Many intro-level courses are taught by theorists—-brilliant minds who *love* mathematical beauty and elegance and whose career is built by proving these things. That’s the lens they view the world with. And let’s be honest: creating a course from scratch is hard. It’s easier to use your advisor’s slides, and it doesn’t help you get tenure.

That’s how I taught my first two econometrics courses. But I couldn’t stop thinking: *Am I actually helping my students?*

My strength was always in asking: *What does this tool let me do? How can I use it to solve a real problem?* And I wasn’t showing my students how to think that way.

This doesn’t mean I ignore theory—I still want to understand how the wrench works. But once I do, I’d rather fix something than keep polishing the wrench. (Not that polishing is bad. Many great inventions come from it. It’s just not where *I* find joy.)

So I asked myself: *What will my students actually use?* Most of them won’t go on to develop new estimators or prove consistency. They’re going to work in industry. They’ll need to read charts, clean messy data, run regressions, make decisions, and communicate results clearly.

They need to reason with data. They need **data literacy**.

## Some of the Smartest People Fear Data, Too

While I struggled with theory in college, many of my colleagues today—-brilliant theorists from places like MIT and Princeton—-are scared of application.

They aced all the econometrics and statistics classes. But when it comes time to analyze actual data or read an empirical paper, they freeze. They want to get their hands dirty, but don’t know where to start.  (Some even try to “prepare” by reading more theory, which only makes them more anxious, because you unlock one door, and 10 more appear.)

That was their version of my algebra class. Intimidation, just from the other side.

So now I ask: *How can we build a bridge between these two worlds?*

## What This Blog (and Book) Is Really For

That’s why I’m writing this blog—-and eventually, this book.

Not to teach you how to code every model or derive every estimator from scratch. There are already hundreds of books and courses that do that.

Instead, I want to offer you:

- A **bird’s-eye view** of the field—what data science, econometrics, statistics, and machine learning are really about, and how they fit together.
- A **set of stories** to help you reason clearly through data problems.
- A **framework** for thinking like an applied person—how to ask the right questions, choose the right tools, and make better decisions with data.

Because data is everywhere. From MLB baseball player estimating his batting average, to a TikToker reacting to engagement stats, to a friend tracking their portfolio, to you choosing breakfast based on what you ate last night—-it’s all data. 

But the gap between “data is everywhere” and “I know what to do with data” is enormous, and that’s the gap I want to help close.

## A Quick Thanks

This project wouldn’t exist without the encouragement—-and occasional scolding—-of my brilliant coauthor, Lareina Wang, who keeps reminding me to write vividly (and less like a professor), and to Rui Wang, whose belief in the idea gave me the push I needed to bring this idea back to life.
